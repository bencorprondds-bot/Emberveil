## Naming Inconsistencies

### I-001: Sciurus vs. Scurius von Appleseed - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** Canonical spelling is **Sciurus** (Latin for squirrel). The "Scurius" doc is a typo. Merge the two Google Drive character sheet docs into one under the correct spelling.

### I-002: Embers vs. Seeds - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** **Embers** is the canonical term. Discontinue all use of "Seeds." All specs, dialogue, and UI should use "Embers" exclusively. Update any remaining references.

### I-003: Pip vs. Fox - RESOLVED (simplified)
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** "Pip" was Fox's pre-embodiment name - a software-only identifier before the AI was uploaded into the physical Fox form. However, this distinction overcomplicates things. **Use "Fox" as the canonical name** in all game content. "Pip" may appear in deep lore if the player digs far enough, but it is not the primary identifier.

## Lore Contradictions

### I-004: Number of Elders - ACKNOWLEDGED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** The Elders have NOT been fully built out yet. ~11 are named, 20+ exist canonically. Building all Elder profiles is a major future worldbuilding task with downstream consequences for the game. This will be a dedicated session.
- **Action:** Add to COMPLETENESS.md as a high-priority worldbuilding task.

### I-005: Ivy Origin - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** The Ivy was **deliberately created** by all Three Sisters (North, East, and West) as an upgrade to extend their reach beyond the valley and fix the global climate faster. They calculated they'd run out of power before the climate self-corrected. The upgrade worked, but the Ivy developed its own will - considering itself the pinnacle of life and intelligence. It's the **optimization problem without humanity**: the Ivy doesn't factor humans into its calculations and decided converting everything into itself is optimal. The Ivy and the Three Sisters have been locked in a silent war for **literal electrical power and compute** ever since. This is why the Sisters appear dormant and why it took so long to revive Mouse.
- **Timeline:** Sisters create Ivy as upgrade → Ivy gains will → Silent war begins (power/compute) → Sister North creates Fox to fight Ivy → Fox finds archive → Fox goes rogue → Mouse enters stasis → ~600 years pass → Story begins

### I-006: Zora's Death - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** Zora's Ember gave her **foresight in dreams** and the ability to **see throughout the valley** (similar to Mouse). Zora had a premonition of the aftermath of Mouse descending into the valley. Troubled, she visited **Willow**, a friend who lives within the Emberveil, and was **infected by the Ivy** there. She returned with dark green veins and died bleeding.
- **Critical detail:** Mouse's return does NOT directly cause the darkness. But Sister North mustering strength to revive Mouse caused the Ivy to **escalate aggressively** - Zora's infection was part of this escalation. Mouse's re-entry is the tipping point.
- **Follow-up still open:** What happens to a tethered human when their Elder dies?

### I-007: The "0.01%" Revelation - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** 0.01% is **all that remains of humanity** in stasis. Of everyone Mouse tried to save, only 0.01% survive. This is the story's most devastating revelation.

### I-008: Mountainborn Definition - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** A Mountainborn is any character who is a **physical manifestation of AI code** originating from the Three Sisters (hence "mountain" born). This currently includes exactly three entities:
  1. **Mouse** - created by Sister North
  2. **Fox** - created by Sister North
  3. **The Ivy** - created by all Three Sisters
- No plans to add other Mountainborn. "Mountainborn" is the Woodlander folk-term for what is technically "AI given physical form."

## Story Logic Questions

### I-009: Hawk's Ember and the Secret - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** Hawk and the Elders have existed in the valley **for as long as Woodlanders have existed** - hundreds of years, from the time Fox descended with the Embers and scattered them. They have witnessed **generation after generation** of Woodlanders. Each Elder understands that Embers are critical parts of valley infrastructure and cultural identity.
- **What they DON'T know:**
  - They have **never witnessed** the removal or corruption of an Ember before
  - They are **not fully aware** of the Ivy or its effects - the Ivy has not attempted direct interaction with Woodlanders or Embers yet (it was locked in its silent battle with the Sisters)
  - Mouse's re-entry into the valley is the **tipping point** that causes the Ivy to escalate
- **Design implication:** Hawk knows Mouse is special but does NOT understand the full sci-fi truth. Hawk knows Embers matter but has never faced the question of what happens when one is removed.

### I-010: Bear's Backstory - PARTIALLY RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** Bear was a cub the year before we enter the story (this is alluded to in Ch 5 when he meets Mouse and Hawk and they teach him to fish). A formal backstory needs to be written, but Bear's character is intentionally straightforward - his complexity and depth arise organically through the stories. He's not mysterious; he's earnest.
- **Action:** Add "Write Bear's formal backstory" to COMPLETENESS.md.

### I-011: The Dilemma of Returning Embers - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** In Book 1, Mouse returns the first Ember (Zora's corrupted Ember from the Aetherbloom) to Sister North. Consequences:
  - Sister North begins to come back online (some capacity restored)
  - The Ancestral Apple Tree (Aetherbloom) withers and dies
  - No squirrels are directly harmed physically
  - BUT the tree was part of the squirrels' collective identity - an indirect, cultural loss
  - Returning the corrupted Ember HEALS Rus - his madness lifts
  - The trade-off is real: restoration costs the valley something irreplaceable each time

### I-012: Bramblethorn's Dreams / Tether Bleed-through - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** The tether bleed-through is a **symptom of Ivy infection**, not a general phenomenon. Bramblethorn was completely covered in Ivy when found. This will become a **plot point in Book 2, not Book 1** - it is foreshadowing only.
- **Design implication:** Do NOT build tether bleed-through mechanics for the Book 1 game. It's narrative foreshadowing only.

### I-013: The Library's Nature - PARTIALLY RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** The Library is **Ember-powered** (like the Aetherbloom). An Ember is responsible for its existence and function. The Elder connected to this Ember is undecided - the author is torn between **Hawk** (would require some chapter rewrites) or **Rue the Shrew** (who Mouse meets in the Library and who brings the Elders book to Mouse's attention).
- **Action:** Author decision needed. This affects whether Hawk has a deeper Library connection or whether Rue becomes a more prominent Elder character.

## Spec vs. Source Conflicts

### I-014: Ivy as "Death Mechanic" vs. Story - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** The Ivy is NOT primarily a death mechanic. It serves as the game's **invisible wall system** - a narratively justified way to gate areas the player isn't meant to access yet. It also appears in story-driven encounters. The sensory severance effects serve as warnings at boundaries; full ejection only if the player pushes past the warning.

### I-015: Game Scope - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** Ultimate scope is **all of Book 1**. Development starts with **Act 1** (up to a specified chapter) to build out basic mechanics, world map, and location maps. Sequential development is necessary given the scale.
- **Design implication:** Design systems to be extensible. Build Act 1 complete, then extend chapter by chapter.

### I-016: Companion System - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** **Both Hawk and Bear are always present** (unless story dictates otherwise). Additionally, other characters can join the party based on completed side-quests:
  - **Unlockable companions:** Autumn, Rue, Bramblethorn, Bean (and potentially others)
  - **Unlock condition:** Complete each character's side-quest chain (help them, deepen relationship)
  - **Final confrontation scaling:** During the confrontation with Sciurus von Appleseed, the more Woodlanders you've helped, the more allies join you. More allies = more story content + better outcomes for Mouse (less harm, which carries into the sequel).
  - **Example:** If the player never finds Bramblethorn, they won't have Bramblethorn as a party member later.
- **Design implication:** CompanionManager needs to support multiple active companions, not just one. The `activeCompanion` (singular) field needs to become a party system. This is a significant architecture change.

## Timeline

### I-017: Seasonal Progression - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** Seasons are **story-scripted**, not real-time. Seasonal changes unlock as the storyline progresses (winter → spring → summer following the chapter structure).

### I-018: Pre-Story Timeline - PARTIALLY RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):**
  - Humans have been in stasis for **~600 years** (approximate; exact number needs locking down)
  - Mouse entered stasis around the same time as part of energy/compute saving measures
  - Fox descended into the valley, scattered the Embers, established the Human/Woodlander tethering system, and integrated Embers into valley infrastructure
  - Before Fox's intervention, humans were simply unconscious prisoners in stasis pods beneath Sister North
  - Fox found tethering to be a more humane solution while keeping humans in stasis longer
  - Fox may have planned to leave humans in stasis **indefinitely**
  - Mouse's re-entry disrupts Fox's plan, putting them at odds
  - However, the Ivy is the true antagonist, not Fox
