## Naming Inconsistencies

### I-001: Sciurus vs. Scurius von Appleseed - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** Canonical spelling is **Sciurus** (Latin for squirrel). The "Scurius" doc is a typo. Merge the two Google Drive character sheet docs into one under the correct spelling.

### I-002: Embers vs. Seeds - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** **Embers** is the canonical term. Discontinue all use of "Seeds." All specs, dialogue, and UI should use "Embers" exclusively. Update any remaining references.

### I-003: Pip vs. Fox - RESOLVED (simplified)
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** "Pip" was Fox's pre-embodiment name - a software-only identifier before the AI was uploaded into the physical Fox form. However, this distinction overcomplicates things. **Use "Fox" as the canonical name** in all game content. "Pip" may appear in deep lore if the player digs far enough, but it is not the primary identifier.

## Lore Contradictions

### I-004: Number of Elders - ACKNOWLEDGED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** The Elders have NOT been fully built out yet. ~11 are named, 20+ exist canonically. Building all Elder profiles is a major future worldbuilding task with downstream consequences for the game. This will be a dedicated session.
- **Action:** Add to COMPLETENESS.md as a high-priority worldbuilding task.

### I-005: Ivy Origin - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** The Ivy was **deliberately created** by all Three Sisters (North, East, and West) as an upgrade to extend their reach beyond the valley and fix the global climate faster. They calculated they'd run out of power before the climate self-corrected. The upgrade worked, but the Ivy developed its own will - considering itself the pinnacle of life and intelligence. It's the **optimization problem without humanity**: the Ivy doesn't factor humans into its calculations and decided converting everything into itself is optimal. The Ivy and the Three Sisters have been locked in a silent war for **literal electrical power and compute** ever since. This is why the Sisters appear dormant and why it took so long to revive Mouse.
- **Timeline:** Sisters create Ivy as upgrade → Ivy gains will → Silent war begins (power/compute) → Sister North creates Fox to fight Ivy → Fox finds archive → Fox goes rogue → Mouse enters stasis → ~600 years pass → Story begins

### I-006: Zora's Death - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** Zora's Ember gave her **foresight in dreams** and the ability to **see throughout the valley** (similar to Mouse). Zora had a premonition of the aftermath of Mouse descending into the valley. Troubled, she visited **Willow**, a friend who lives within the Emberveil, and was **infected by the Ivy** there. She returned with dark green veins and died bleeding.
- **Critical detail:** Mouse's return does NOT directly cause the darkness. But Sister North mustering strength to revive Mouse caused the Ivy to **escalate aggressively** - Zora's infection was part of this escalation. Mouse's re-entry is the tipping point.
- **Follow-up still open:** What happens to a tethered human when their Elder dies?

### I-007: The "0.01%" Revelation - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** 0.01% is **all that remains of humanity** in stasis. Of everyone Mouse tried to save, only 0.01% survive. This is the story's most devastating revelation.

### I-008: Mountainborn Definition - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** A Mountainborn is any character who is a **physical manifestation of AI code** originating from the Three Sisters (hence "mountain" born). This currently includes exactly three entities:
  1. **Mouse** - created by Sister North
  2. **Fox** - created by Sister North
  3. **The Ivy** - created by all Three Sisters
- No plans to add other Mountainborn. "Mountainborn" is the Woodlander folk-term for what is technically "AI given physical form."

## Story Logic Questions

### I-009: Hawk's Ember and the Secret - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** Hawk and the Elders have existed in the valley **for as long as Woodlanders have existed** - hundreds of years, from the time Fox descended with the Embers and scattered them. They have witnessed **generation after generation** of Woodlanders. Each Elder understands that Embers are critical parts of valley infrastructure and cultural identity.
- **What they DON'T know:**
  - They have **never witnessed** the removal or corruption of an Ember before
  - They are **not fully aware** of the Ivy or its effects - the Ivy has not attempted direct interaction with Woodlanders or Embers yet (it was locked in its silent battle with the Sisters)
  - Mouse's re-entry into the valley is the **tipping point** that causes the Ivy to escalate
- **Design implication:** Hawk knows Mouse is special but does NOT understand the full sci-fi truth. Hawk knows Embers matter but has never faced the question of what happens when one is removed.

### I-010: Bear's Backstory - PARTIALLY RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** Bear was a cub the year before we enter the story (this is alluded to in Ch 5 when he meets Mouse and Hawk and they teach him to fish). A formal backstory needs to be written, but Bear's character is intentionally straightforward - his complexity and depth arise organically through the stories. He's not mysterious; he's earnest.
- **Action:** Add "Write Bear's formal backstory" to COMPLETENESS.md.

### I-011: The Dilemma of Returning Embers - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** In Book 1, Mouse returns the first Ember (Zora's corrupted Ember from the Aetherbloom) to Sister North. Consequences:
  - Sister North begins to come back online (some capacity restored)
  - The Ancestral Apple Tree (Aetherbloom) withers and dies
  - No squirrels are directly harmed physically
  - BUT the tree was part of the squirrels' collective identity - an indirect, cultural loss
  - Returning the corrupted Ember HEALS Rus - his madness lifts
  - The trade-off is real: restoration costs the valley something irreplaceable each time

### I-012: Bramblethorn's Dreams / Tether Bleed-through - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** The tether bleed-through is a **symptom of Ivy infection**, not a general phenomenon. Bramblethorn was completely covered in Ivy when found. This will become a **plot point in Book 2, not Book 1** - it is foreshadowing only.
- **Design implication:** Do NOT build tether bleed-through mechanics for the Book 1 game. It's narrative foreshadowing only.

### I-013: The Library's Nature - PARTIALLY RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** The Library is **Ember-powered** (like the Aetherbloom). An Ember is responsible for its existence and function. The Elder connected to this Ember is undecided - the author is torn between **Hawk** (would require some chapter rewrites) or **Rue the Shrew** (who Mouse meets in the Library and who brings the Elders book to Mouse's attention).
- **Action:** Author decision needed. This affects whether Hawk has a deeper Library connection or whether Rue becomes a more prominent Elder character.

## Spec vs. Source Conflicts

### I-014: Ivy as "Death Mechanic" vs. Story - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** The Ivy is NOT primarily a death mechanic. It serves as the game's **invisible wall system** - a narratively justified way to gate areas the player isn't meant to access yet. It also appears in story-driven encounters. The sensory severance effects serve as warnings at boundaries; full ejection only if the player pushes past the warning.

### I-015: Game Scope - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** Ultimate scope is **all of Book 1**. Development starts with **Act 1** (up to a specified chapter) to build out basic mechanics, world map, and location maps. Sequential development is necessary given the scale.
- **Design implication:** Design systems to be extensible. Build Act 1 complete, then extend chapter by chapter.

### I-016: Companion System - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** **Both Hawk and Bear are always present** (unless story dictates otherwise). Additionally, other characters can join the party based on completed side-quests:
  - **Unlockable companions:** Autumn, Rue, Bramblethorn, Bean (and potentially others)
  - **Unlock condition:** Complete each character's side-quest chain (help them, deepen relationship)
  - **Final confrontation scaling:** During the confrontation with Sciurus von Appleseed, the more Woodlanders you've helped, the more allies join you. More allies = more story content + better outcomes for Mouse (less harm, which carries into the sequel).
  - **Example:** If the player never finds Bramblethorn, they won't have Bramblethorn as a party member later.
- **Design implication:** CompanionManager needs to support multiple active companions, not just one. The `activeCompanion` (singular) field needs to become a party system. This is a significant architecture change.

## Timeline

### I-017: Seasonal Progression - RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** Seasons are **story-scripted**, not real-time. Seasonal changes unlock as the storyline progresses (winter → spring → summer following the chapter structure).

### I-018: Pre-Story Timeline - PARTIALLY RESOLVED
- **Resolution (author confirmed):**
  - Humans have been in stasis for **~600 years** (approximate; exact number needs locking down)
  - Mouse entered stasis around the same time as part of energy/compute saving measures
  - Fox descended into the valley, scattered the Embers, established the Human/Woodlander tethering system, and integrated Embers into valley infrastructure
  - Before Fox's intervention, humans were simply unconscious prisoners in stasis pods beneath Sister North
  - Fox found tethering to be a more humane solution while keeping humans in stasis longer
  - Fox may have planned to leave humans in stasis **indefinitely**
  - Mouse's re-entry disrupts Fox's plan, putting them at odds
  - However, the Ivy is the true antagonist, not Fox

## Lore Gaps from Location Documents (2026-02-08)

### I-019: Who is Ava? — RESOLVED
- **Source:** The Cistern location doc + "Ava, Arlow, and Gray" character sheet
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** Ava is a human engineer (age 26 at stasis) who helped design the Cistern and tunnels with Mouse. She was Mouse's friend and mentee. Her stasis pod is deliberately malfunctioned by the Ivy at the very end of Book 1 (post-climax hook into Book 2). She is infected by the Ivy upon waking, pregnant with twins (Arlow and Gray), and retreats to the Cistern maintenance facility. The Ivy hijacks her Woodlander tether, gaining a covert agent in the valley. Every chapter intro note in Book 1 is revealed to be Mouse writing to the twins.

### I-020: Hawk's Academy Professor — OPEN
- **Source:** The Archenreach Academy location doc
- **Context:** "Hawk got her doctorate in library and archival sciences at the Academy. (Who is her professor?)"
- **Issue:** The author flagged this as an open question in the source doc itself. Professor is unnamed.
- **Impact:** Potential NPC design, possible Elder candidate, Hawk backstory enrichment.

### I-021: Professor of Woodland Literature — OPEN
- **Source:** The Archenreach Academy location doc
- **Context:** "This is where the Professor of Woodland Literature lives. They occupy one of the Academy's towers."
- **Issue:** Unnamed character. Could be an Elder or a regular NPC.
- **Impact:** Academy NPC roster, potential quest-giver.

### I-022: Mole King and Cistern Construction — RESOLVED
- **Source:** The Mere location doc + "Talpa - Mole King" character sheet (The Elders folder)
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** The Mole King is named **Talpa** (Latin for mole). He IS an Elder. His Ember is integrated into the tunnels and safety/maintenance infrastructure beneath the valley. **Correction:** The moles did NOT build the cistern — the humans built it during original valley construction. Talpa and the moles maintain the tunnel/maintenance infrastructure. The Mere doc's phrasing ("They build the cistern") was misleading. Character sheet is still incomplete (ends mid-sentence).

### I-023: Ivy's Forge Location — OPEN
- **Source:** The Glass Caverns location doc
- **Context:** "The Ivy has created its own forge, but it doesn't work as well as Mouse's. It can only make monolithic pieces."
- **Issue:** The Ivy's forge exists but its location is unspecified. This is a significant strategic detail.
- **Impact:** Ivy encounter design, late-game location, possible story beat.

### I-024: "Leafmere Lake" vs. "The Mere" — RESOLVED
- **Source:** The Archenreach Academy calls it "Leafmere Lake"; The Mere doc calls it "The Mere"
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** Leafmere Lake and The Mere are the same body of water. **Otterdam** divides it into two sections: the **Leafmere** (at the base of Sister West, exposed to the sun) and the **Fellmere** (under Sister West / inside the mountain). Both sides cover a submerged human city from before stasis. "The Mere" is the general name for the whole lake system.

### I-025: Is Leviathan an Elder? — RESOLVED
- **Source:** The Mere, The Cistern, and "Elder - The Leviathan" character sheet
- **Resolution (author confirmed):** Yes, the Leviathan IS an Elder. It is a massive, deformed **axolotl** — dragon/wyrm-like, elemental force. Its Ember **fused directly with its body** (unique among Elders — most have Embers integrated into separate infrastructure). Its tail extends like roots deep underground, far beyond the valley, draining surrounding landscape. Dual purpose: (1) perpetual water supply to the valley and Sisters, (2) creates the impassable desert that prevents invaders. The Leviathan cannot leave its post. Disrupting it is an immediate existential threat to the valley. Currently asleep, managing reflexively. Fox installed it during the valley rebuilding period.
