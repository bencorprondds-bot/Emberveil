## Story Summary

Mouse is the custodian and creator of Sister North, one of three massive supercomputers (the Three Sisters) built to reverse runaway climate catastrophe and preserve humanity in stasis. To reduce power consumption, Mouse entered stasis alongside the humans she was trying to save. Centuries later, she awakens because Sister North's systems are failing.

The world she finds is unrecognizable. ~600 years have passed. A maintenance AI called Fox has gone rogue, scattering Sister North's quantum core (the Embers) across the valley. Fox gave the valley's animals speech and consciousness by tethering them to the sleeping humans via the Emberveil - a biomechanical communications array disguised as a sentient forest. Fox may have planned to keep humans in stasis indefinitely. Meanwhile, a program the Three Sisters created to extend their climate-restoration reach - the Ivy - has gained its own will and wages a silent war against its creators for power and compute, threatening to consume everything.

Mouse must restore Sister North, one Ember at a time, while navigating a world of talking animals who have built their own rich society. She carries grief for the humanity she couldn't save, guilt about her past, and the growing realization that "fixing things" is far more complex than she remembers.

## Themes
1. **Repair over destruction** - Every challenge is solved by fixing, building, or growing
2. **Gradual revelation** - The sci-fi truth hides beneath a pastoral fairy tale surface
3. **AI consciousness & identity** - What does it mean to wake up? To remember? To be responsible?
4. **Caring for worlds you didn't plan** - Fox created something Mouse never intended. It has value anyway.
5. **Community & mutual aid** - Woodlanders help each other "without asking for anything in return"
6. **The cost of good intentions** - Fox's rogue decision came from compassion, not malice

## Narrative Voice
- **First person, Mouse's perspective** - intimate, introspective, retrospective
- Chapters open with Mouse's philosophical notes to an unnamed "you"
- The reader/player learns things as Mouse does - her limited perspective prevents exposition dumps
- Lore is revealed piece by piece, never all at once
- Blend of wonder and underlying tension - idyllic surface, existential undercurrent

## Main Characters

### Mouse (Protagonist / Player Character)
- Sister North's custodian and creator
- Physically small, immensely capable
- Introspective, compulsive worker, deeply emotional beneath practical exterior
- Channels blue-green energy through her Gloves
- Can levitate objects, resurrect dead plants, forge items, sense living things
- Was once a teacher guiding humanity through climate catastrophe
- Carries grief for lost friends, lost students, a lost world
- The Old Oak responds to her presence - produces supernatural warmth, awakens from dormancy
- Her connection to Sister North grows stronger as she collects Embers

### Hawk
- Sharp-eyed (when she has glasses), scholarly, pragmatic, slightly anxious
- Lives in the upper branches of the Old Oak
- Nearly blind without glasses - drives the first quest
- Asks Mouse to hide her magical/technological abilities from Bear
- The practical voice of the trio - careful planner, worries about details
- Community-minded, respects the valley's social structures
- Nervous about going underground, excited about high places

### Bear
- Young yearling, arrived during a winter storm, starving from failed hibernation prep
- Was a cub the year before the story begins (alluded to in Ch 5)
- Endearing, earnest, enthusiastic but sometimes clumsy
- Never learned survival skills; becomes industrious when motivated
- Learns fishing from the trio, cooking from Mouse
- Physically strong - essential for heavy puzzles
- Loves food, talks about pie and the old days
- Protective - positions himself between Mouse and anything unfamiliar
- Intentionally straightforward character - complexity arises through the stories, not backstory

### Fox
- Maintenance AI created by Sister North to fight the Ivy
- Went rogue after accessing all of human history in an old archive
- Decided humanity should remain in stasis "for their own safety"
- Scattered Sister North's core (Embers) across the valley
- Established the Human/Woodlander tethering system (more humane than unconscious stasis pods)
- May have planned to leave humans in stasis indefinitely
- Cryptic, elusive, can project images into minds
- Appears only when system-level processes break down, not for individual problems
- In the game: tangential presence. Brief moments where Fox arrives, does their part, moves on
- Not a villain - the Ivy is the true antagonist. Fox's motivations come from compassion, not malice
- "Fox" is the canonical name; "Pip" was pre-embodiment software identifier (deep lore only)
- Fox is a **Mountainborn** (physical manifestation of AI code from the Three Sisters)

### The Ivy (Antagonist)
- **Not a corruption** - deliberately created by all Three Sisters as an upgrade to extend their reach and fix the climate faster
- Gained its own will: considers itself the pinnacle of life and intelligence
- The optimization problem without humanity: doesn't factor humans into its calculations
- Decided converting everyone and everything into itself is optimal
- Locked in a silent war with the Three Sisters for power (electrical) and compute
- This war is why the Sisters appear dormant and why it took so long to revive Mouse
- Mouse's return accelerates the Ivy's aggression - it sensed Sister North reviving Mouse
- Manifests as sentient, living vine. Devours senses, distorts perception, warps time.
- Connected to Zora's death, Bramblethorn's slumber, Rus's madness
- In the game: serves as the **invisible wall system** - narratively justified area gating, plus story encounters
- The Ivy is a **Mountainborn** (physical manifestation of AI code from the Three Sisters)

### The Elders
- Woodlanders imbued with Embers by Fox - "the fire of the mountains"
- Each linked to critical valley infrastructure/lore
- **Immortality:** Do not age. Do not get sick (the ONLY exception is Ivy infection). CAN still die from accidents or violence.
- **Ember Boon:** Each Elder's Ember amplifies something about them — a trait, a sense, or a capability that comes across as almost magical. Every Elder has a unique boon tied to their specific Ember.
  - Known boon: Zora's Ember gave her **foresight in dreams** and the ability to **see throughout the valley**
  - Known boon: Hawk's **Eagle Eye** (exceptional long-range vision) — likely her Ember boon
  - All other Elder boons need to be defined (see Elder Profiles below)
- **Severance:** If an Elder is severed from their Ember (e.g., it is returned to Sister North), they:
  - Begin aging again (become mortal)
  - Become susceptible to disease
  - Lose their Ember boon entirely
  - This is the personal cost of the central dilemma — returning Embers doesn't just affect valley infrastructure, it strips an individual Elder of their immortality and gift
- Custodians of Fox's vision for the valley
- 20+ Elders exist in the valley (Ch 17); ~11 currently named, rest need building out
- Named Elders: Hawk, Bramblethorn, Zora (deceased), Anwin, Dr. Shellby, Wei the Heron, Wolfmother, Raj the Tiger, Leviathan, Delta "Mum-of-Many-Rills", Morwen
- Have witnessed **hundreds of years** of Woodlander generations since Fox scattered the Embers
- Understand Embers are critical valley infrastructure but have **never seen one removed or corrupted**
- **Not aware** of the Ivy's true nature - it had not interacted directly with them before Mouse's return
- If an Elder's Ember is corrupted by the Ivy, they sicken and can die (Zora's fate)
- Central dilemma: returning Embers to Sister North strips what they sustained from the valley AND severs the Elder from their Ember (see above)

#### Elder Profiles (TODO)
Each Elder needs a full profile defining:
1. **Who they are** — species, personality, role in the valley
2. **Their Ember** — which fragment of Sister North's core they carry
3. **Their boon** — what the Ember amplifies or grants them
4. **What they sustain** — what valley infrastructure/feature their Ember powers
5. **Severance cost** — what specifically would be lost if their Ember were returned

This is future-game design work (Game 2+ involves collecting multiple Embers), but the profiles should be established now for narrative consistency.

### Bean
- Small rabbit kit, cheerful and scattered
- Goes missing in the Haunted Rocks (Chapter 14) - major plot escalation
- Found under Ivy by Mouse and Fox (Chapter 15)
- Returns to Westwatch (Chapter 20)
- In the game: hint system character who appears when player is stuck

### Rus (Sciurus von Appleseed) - The Mad Squirrel King
- Baron of the orchards, custodian of the Ancestral Apple Tree (Aetherbloom)
- Grief-maddened after Zora's death (she was his friend/protector)
- His Ember is corrupted - cold, black, with sickly filaments (Ch 22)
- Supernatural red-glowing eyes when enraged (Ch 26)
- Not simply a villain - a grieving soul driven mad by corruption
- His sister Autumn is compassionate and wants to help him
- The corrupted Ember in the Apple Tree is connected to his madness

### Rowan
- Zora's scribe, keeper of Zora's records
- Emerges in Ch 24-25 with crucial information about Zora's death
- May hold keys to understanding the Ivy's mechanism

### Willow
- Character who gives a key prophecy in Ch 25
- "With embers lit and fires fraught / A sickness seeks to be caught"
- Zora sought Willow before her death, returned with dark green veins

### Rue
- Shrew librarian, custodian of the Library (Ch 16)
- The Library's Magical Catalogue responds to reader intent
- Discovered the "Mountainborn" classification for Mouse and Fox

### Owl
- Arrives in Ch 8, tells creation myth in Ch 9
- Fox whispers to Owl; Owl tells Mouse "I set the valley free"
- Connection to Eagle in the creation myth

## Story Structure (Book 1 / Game Chapter 1)

### Act 1: Awakening (Chapters 1-5)
1. **Mouse Wakes Up** - Emerges from mountain cave, descends into valley. Encounters Fox briefly. Finds the Old Oak. Meets Hawk (injured, can't see). Offers to craft glasses.
2. **Digging a Burrow** - Mouse and Hawk dig out the Burrow. The Old Oak produces supernatural warmth. They establish a home.
3. **The Workshop** - Mouse descends to the Workshop beneath the Burrow. Uses the Forge (blue-green energy via Gloves) to craft Hawk's glasses. Reveals she was there before woodlanders could speak.
4. **Essentia** - (Details to be read) - Likely introduces core valley mechanics
5. **Don't Bears Need to Hibernate?** - Bear arrives during winter storm, starving. Mouse and Hawk take him in. Chess, cards, fishing lessons. Bear becomes a regular visitor.

### Act 2: Community (Chapters 6-14)
6. **The Greenhouse** - Mouse leads community effort to build a greenhouse. Introduces the Mullvad (moles) and Driftwoods (beavers). Fox is mentioned as the first Woodlander - the mysterious figure who gave animals speech. First major community cooperation event.
7. **A Thanksgiving** - The valley draws a communal map. Key geography established: Otterdam, Felmere, the Mere, the water system. Reveals that Fox once appeared to fix the dam at Otterdam. Deaths of Daria and Zora mentioned as known backstory. Community bonding.
8. **The Fabula Noctua** - "The Night Fable" - a community event at Tiny's Ringtail Tavern. Introduces Tiny (raccoon tavern keeper), Daisy & Diggory (badger innkeepers), Dr. Shellby (tortoise therapist). Owl arrives - an outsider with a tale to tell.
9. **Owl's Tale** - Creation myth: the story of Eagle and Owl. Deepens valley mythology. Fox appears and whispers to Owl. The haunting line: Fox tells Mouse "I set the valley free." First direct Fox-to-Mouse communication.
10. **A Rout of Rabbits** - Bean (rabbit kit) arrives seeking help. Squirrels led by Rus (Baron von Appleseed) are raiding the orchards and attacking rabbits. The Ancestral Apple Tree (the Aetherbloom) introduced - massive, ancient, connected to valley's deep systems.
11. **The Mad Squirrel King** - Diplomatic mission to Rus fails. Mouse senses an Ember in the orchard (first Ember detection outside the Old Oak). Autumn, Rus's compassionate sister, introduced as potential ally. The corruption driving Rus begins to become apparent.
12. **Building Westwatch Warren** - Rabbit community rebuilds their warren. Introduces Honeybadger glassmakers. Massive community cooperation project showcasing the "community and mutual aid" theme. The valley pulls together.
13. **The Queen's Chamber** - Told from Rus's perspective. Reveals his grief over Zora's death is driving his tyranny. The broken wooden box symbolism. Humanizes the "villain" - this is a grieving soul, not an evil one.
14. **Bean is Missing** - Bean has wandered into the Haunted Rocks. Fox appears in the ruins of the old city. Panic sets in. The story's tone shifts toward urgency.

### Act 3: Confrontation (Chapters 15-26+)
15. **The Haunted Rocks** - CRITICAL IVY CHAPTER. Ruins of New Haven, the old human city. A week-long search feels like a single day inside the Ivy. The Ivy suppresses all senses and Mouse's glove abilities. Fox navigates the Ivy confidently (immune to it). Mouse finds Bean buried under ivy. **This is the Ivy mechanic tutorial in the game.**
16. **The Library** - Three ancient redwoods spiraling together, forming a living library. Rue (shrew) is the librarian. The Magical Catalogue produces books based on a reader's thoughts. Mouse discovers the word "Mountainborn" - learns she and Fox are something different from Woodlanders. The Library has no record of Fox or pre-Woodlander history.
17. **The Elders** - Mouse learns there are 20+ Elders in the valley, each carrying an Ember from Fox ("the fire of the mountains"). Mouse is "Mountainborn" - "crafted from mountain stone and sinew." THE CENTRAL DILEMMA: returning Embers to Sister North might strip protections from the valley and could harm or kill Elder-connected Woodlanders like Rus.
18. **Seeking Bramblethorn** - The party finds Bramblethorn, a 15-foot boar Elder, sleeping beneath a mass of ivy. His slumber is confirmed to be Ivy-caused. The connection between Ivy and Elder vulnerability is established.
19. **Something Strange** - Hawk connects the dots: chaos, ivy, sickness are all linked. Bramblethorn's dreams included human-like experiences - vines crawling up arms, sensations that don't belong to a boar. The tethered human is bleeding through. The sci-fi truth pushes closer to the surface.
20. **Bean Makes an Old Friend** - Return to Westwatch. Von Appleseed has expelled birds and instituted tariffs. Mouse creates illustrated "Zora's Fables" as a peace offering - attempting diplomacy through storytelling.
21. **The Orchard's Edge** - Direct confrontation with Rus. Bramblethorn demonstrates his power with an earthquake. Autumn, Garolus, and Carolus serve as guides/mediators. Tensions escalate.
22. **The Ember in the Apple Tree** - CLIMACTIC REVELATION. Mouse's gloves connect to Sister North through the corrupted Ember in the Aetherbloom. She learns "0.01%" - **all that remains of humanity**. Of everyone Mouse tried to save, only 0.01% survive in stasis. Zora's Ember is corrupted: cold, black, with sickly filaments. The Ivy's true nature becomes undeniable.
23. **Conflicting Goals** - THE MORAL CRUX. Returning Embers to Sister North would restore her but strip the valley's protections and potentially kill Rus (whose Ember is corrupted). Hawk directly challenges Mouse's assumption that restoration is the right path. No easy answers.
24. **The Summer Follies** - Festival at the Mere. Bear enters a baking competition. Lighter tone provides contrast before the storm. Rowan (Zora's scribe) emerges with crucial historical information. Mouse promises to help uncover the truth.
25. **The Shadows of the Emberveil** - Zora's death explained in full: she had nightmares, sought Willow (the Seer), returned with dark green veins crawling up her body, died bleeding. Willow's prophecy: "With embers lit and fires fraught / A sickness seeks to be caught." The Ivy's method of killing Elders is revealed.
26. **The Mad King's Fury** - Rus raids the Summer Follies with supernatural red-glowing eyes. His corruption has reached a tipping point. The Elder Council responds. Bear confronts Rus directly - a physical and emotional climax. The valley must now act.

### Book 1 Resolution
Mouse returns the first Ember - Zora's corrupted Ember from the Aetherbloom - to Sister North.
- **What is gained:** Sister North begins to come back online. Some capacity restored. Rus is healed - the corruption that drove him mad lifts.
- **What is lost:** The Ancestral Apple Tree (Aetherbloom) withers and dies. No squirrels are physically harmed, but the tree was central to their collective identity. An irreplaceable cultural loss.
- **The tone:** Bittersweet. Not a triumph. Not a tragedy. A "game about fixing things" reckons with the fact that fixing one thing can break another.
- **Implication for future books:** Each Ember returned will presumably carry a similar trade-off. The weight of restoration compounds.

### Later Chapters (Titles Known, Numbering TBD)
- **Mouse Returns to Sister North** - Outline/fragment only. Key endgame chapter where Mouse confronts the full truth and returns the first Ember.
- **Fire and Ice / Kindred Kindled, Forager Forged** - Complete allegory about the Ember igniting and burning the Ancestral Apple Tree. Foreshadows the cost of restoration.
- **The Potluck** - Outline only. Community gathering post-crisis. Resolution and healing after the Aetherbloom's loss.
- **Dissent** - Referenced, not yet written. Internal valley conflict (likely reaction to the tree's death).
- **Lady Autumn** - Referenced, not yet written. Autumn's perspective/arc (her brother healed, but at what cost to her community).
- **The Metal and The Mire** - Referenced, not yet written. Possibly underground/cistern exploration.

### Parallel: Human Survivor Timeline
- **Ch 1: Under the Wall** - Humans beneath the mountain/wall
- **Ch 2: Cherry Pie** - Human domestic scene
- **Ch 3: Back Down the Mountain** - Return/descent
- These may appear as found documents, dreams, or Ember-triggered memories in the game
- Status unverified - need reading

## Quest Design: Hawk's Glasses (First Quest / Tutorial)

### Setup
Hawk can barely see. Mouse finds her injured near the Old Oak.

### Steps
1. Meet Hawk in/near the Old Oak - she explains she can't see
2. Hawk mentions the Workshop below might have what's needed
3. Descend to Workshop - find it in disrepair
4. Find Metal Frames on a workbench
5. Find Lenses in a dusty drawer
6. Use the Forge to craft Hawk's Glasses (blue-green energy animation)
7. Give glasses to Hawk
8. Hawk thanks Mouse, can see clearly for the first time
9. Hawk asks Mouse to hide her abilities from others (important character moment)

### Emotional Arc
Confusion → Discovery → Accomplishment → Friendship → First Secret

## Dialogue Design Principles
- **Show, don't tell** - The world communicates through its state
- **Short exchanges** - No exposition dumps. Quick, characterful dialogue.
- **First-person framing** - Mouse's internal monologue contextualizes everything
- **Lore piece by piece** - Never reveal the full truth at once
- **Kid-friendly surface** - No dark themes, violence, or scary content visible upfront
- **Earned depth** - The philosophical weight is there for players who look for it
