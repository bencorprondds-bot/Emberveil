# Narrative Design Specification

## Story Summary

Mouse is an ancient being - small, quiet, immensely capable - who wakes after a long slumber inside the Old Oak in the Valley of Sisters. The world she knew has changed. The valley's systems are broken, its inhabitants struggling, and the Embers (the valley's life force) are fading.

Using her Gloves, Mouse sets out to repair what's broken, reconnect with old friends, and discover what happened while she slept.

## Themes
1. **Repair over destruction** - Every challenge is solved by fixing, building, or growing
2. **AI consciousness & memory** - Mouse's nature raises questions about what it means to wake up, to remember, to care
3. **Caring for worlds you didn't create** - Stewardship, not ownership
4. **Community & friendship** - Problems are solved together with companions
5. **Curiosity as a superpower** - Understanding precedes action

## Dialogue Design Principles
- **Show, don't tell** - Let the world communicate through its state (broken vs. repaired)
- **Short exchanges** - No exposition dumps. Quick, characterful dialogue.
- **Choice matters contextually** - Dialogue options change based on inventory, companions, and world state
- **Kid-friendly** - No dark themes, violence, or scary content. Melancholy is okay; despair is not.

## Quest Design: Hawk's Glasses (First Quest, Vertical Slice)

### Setup
Hawk can barely see. She mentions needing new glasses but the old lens-grinder is gone.

### Steps
1. Talk to Hawk in the Burrow - she explains the problem
2. Hawk mentions the Workshop below might have what's needed
3. Descend to Workshop - find it in disrepair
4. Find Metal Frames on a workbench (pickup)
5. Find Lenses in a dusty drawer (examine + pickup)
6. Use the Forge to craft Hawk's Glasses
7. Return to Burrow, give glasses to Hawk
8. Hawk thanks Mouse, can now see clearly
9. Hawk offers to be a companion (unlocks companion system)

### Emotional Arc
Confusion → Discovery → Accomplishment → Friendship

## World-Building Notes
- The Valley of Sisters has a pastoral European countryside feel
- Technology is embedded in nature (the Gloves look like garden gloves with faint circuitry)
- "Embers" are the valley's energy/life force - visible as floating motes of light
- The Old Oak is literally a giant oak tree that's been hollowed into a home
- Time feels gentle - no urgency, no countdown timers, no fail states
